# Fine-Tuned Llama2 on a single dataset using LoRA and QLoRA techniques


# LoRA:
Efficiently adapts pre-trained models by updating a smaller subset of parameters, reducing computational cost and memory usage while preserving model performance.

# QLoRA:
Enhances LoRA by applying quantization, further minimizing resource consumption and enabling deployment on hardware with limited capabilities without sacrificing accuracy.
